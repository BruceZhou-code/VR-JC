# Project VR-JC

Recently, VR becomes a popular technology, which enables us to explore without going to the real places by devices such as Google Cardboard. In order to prolong the friendship between Japan and China, the project was proposed.

The three clubs, Akashi Jyoken, AMSJXNU IT Club, and AMSJXNU Nippon Bunka Kenkyu Bu, are cooperated in order to convey better experience to viewers.

Google VR (Cardboard 3DoF) & AR (6DoF) and Unity C# are used in this project. And i18n of this project contains Japanese, English, and Chinese.

Welcome to use and contribute to our project to do whatever you want along with GPL v3 license.
